First EDA trying to discover with data who is the greatests singer or music band of all time by Daniel Carrera

This project has been realized using the Python, NumPy, Pandas, MatplotLib, Seaborn, Plotly, Web Scraping with Selenium and Beautiful Soup 4.
  
By analising the music industry sales trend and analyzing by sales, awards, gold and platinum records, Grammys, charts, Spotify plays, hits and tenure on The Hot 100 Billboard and Rolling Stones magazine rankings, an analysis has been made to end the debate of who is the best, most influencial musician of all time.

This is the first EDA project I have done and I'm open to any suggestions or improvements :blush:
